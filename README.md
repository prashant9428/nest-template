# Nest JS Skeleton for REST Application


## Description

- [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

- Nest provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Fastify) but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This allows developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules which are available for the underlying platform.

- There are superb libraries, helpers, and tools that exist for Node (and server-side JavaScript), none of them effectively solve the main problem of â€” Architecture.

- ### Features of NestJS
    - Extensible Approach
    - Easy to use, learn and master
    - Command Line Interface(CLI)
    - Versatile
    - Progressive
    - Implemented Based on SOLID Principles
    - Lazy and Dynamic Modules
    - API Versioning
    - Documentation
    - Open Source
    - Large & Active Community
## Motivation

- With this skeleton, we can easily start a server application using Node.js, Nest JS and TypeScript.
- Rather than spending time on the project setup, get on with the important stuff right away.

Take it for a test drive. We'd love to hear any feedback you have or if you've thought of a new feature.
## Common Features

- Quick start
- Integrated ESLint, Prettier and Husky
- Common Error Handler
- Simple and Standard scaffolding
- Production-Ready Skeleton
- Followed SOLID Principles
## Getting started

Skeleton for REST API applications written in Node JS & Nest JS with TypeScript

### Prerequisites

- Node <https://nodejs.org/en/> *use the LTS version*
- NPM
- Docker <https://www.docker.com/>
    - Install Docker Desktop for MAC: [https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
    - Install Docker Desktop for Windows: [https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- NestJS CLI <https://nestjs.com/>

### Create Development Environment

To get started, clone the repository to your local computer. Use the following command to run in your terminal.

#### Clone The Application

```bash
// clone the application

```
#### Quick Installation

Next, install the packages that are required for this project.

```bash
// Install the required npm modules
$ npm install
```

### Create The Environment Variables

The `config/env/.env` file should be placed in root folder with the following variables.

- `config/env/.env` : Default Environment File
- `config/env/.env.dev` : Development Environment File
- `config/env/.env.test` : Test Environment File
- `config/env/.env.prod` : Production Environment File


```
# config/env/.env.example

APP_NAME=rest_api
NODE_ENV=dev
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_DATABASE=rest_api
DB_USER=user
DB_PASSWORD=root
DB_PORT=3306
```

### Start MySQL Database

In order to use mysql, you need to have it installed in your local machine.
Docker Compose is what we will be using in our case, In the project directory, execute the following command.

```
# build images, create and run containers in background
docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml --env-file ./config/env/.env up -d
```

In order to apply your modified code to a running container, you should add a build option.

```
# if source code is changed, rebuild image, recreate and start container
docker-compose  -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml --env-file ./config/env/.env up -d --build
```

### Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

### Test

For this project, We chose [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as our test framework.
While Mocha is probably more common, Mocha seems to be looking for a new maintainer and setting up TypeScript testing in Jest is wicked simple.


```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```


### Running the build

All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
Npm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.
This is nice because most JavaScript tools have easy to use command line utilities allowing us to not need grunt or gulp to manage our builds.
If you open `package.json`, you will see a `scripts` section with all the different scripts you can call.
To call a script, simply run `npm run <script-name>` from the command line.
You'll notice that npm scripts can call each other which makes it easy to compose complex builds out of simple individual build scripts.
Below is a list of all the scripts this template has available:


| Npm Script | Description  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build`                   | Full build. Runs ALL build tasks |
| `start:debug`                   | Performs a full build and then serves the app in watch mode                                       |
| `lint`                    | Runs ESLint on project files                                                                      |
| `format`             | Runs the file formatter                                                              |
| `serve`                   | Runs node on `dist/server.js` which is the apps entry point                                       |
| `start`                   | Does the same as 'npm run serve'. Can be invoked with `npm start`                                 |
| `test`                    | Runs tests using Jest test runner                                                                 |
| `test:watch`              | Runs tests in watch mode                                                                          |
| `doc`              | Generate the project documenation using `compdoc`
## Project Structure

In a TypeScript project, it's best to have separate _source_  and _distributable_ files.
TypeScript (`.ts`) files live in your `src` folder and after compilation are output as JavaScript (`.js`) in the `dist` folder.
The `test` and `views` folders remain top level as expected.

Please find below a detailed description of the app's folder structures:


> **Note!** Make sure you have already built the app using  `npm run build`
